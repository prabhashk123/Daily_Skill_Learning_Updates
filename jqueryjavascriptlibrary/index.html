        What You Should Already Know
        Before you start studying jQuery, you should have a basic knowledge of:

        HTML
        CSS
        JavaScript
        If you want to study these subjects first, find the tutorials on our Home page.

        What is jQuery?
        jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

        The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

        jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into
        methods that you can call with a single line of code.

        jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

        The jQuery library contains the following features:

        HTML/DOM manipulation
        CSS manipulation
        HTML event methods
        Effects and animations
        AJAX
        Utilities
        Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.

        Why jQuery?
        There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the
        most extendable.

        Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:

        Google
        Microsoft
        IBM
        Netflix
        Will jQuery work in all browsers?

        The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this knowledge into the jQuery
        library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.</div>
