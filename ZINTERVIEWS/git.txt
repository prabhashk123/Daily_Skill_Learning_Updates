Q>git
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, 
usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source
code duringâ€¦ .
=>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): (e.g., Git) Store a complete copy of the codebase
on each user's machine. This allows offline work and more complex branching strategies.

=>Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): (e.g., SVN) Use a central server to store all
versions of the code. Users interact with the server to make changes and access history.

=>Git is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, including tracking changes 
to source code, managing multiple branches of code, collaborating with other developers, 
creating and maintaining releases, and deploying code to production. Git is a complex tool,
but it is well worth learning if you are serious about software development.
=>Git and Github difference.

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git 
without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.

Q-Familiarity with various testing tools.
Ans->Types of Testing Tools:
1.Automation tools: These automate repetitive tasks like regression testing, saving time and
effort. Examples include Selenium, Cypress, Appium, Katalon Studio, SoapUI, etc.
2.Performance testing tools: These measure an application's performance under load,
identifying bottlenecks. Examples include Apache JMeter, LoadRunner, K6, etc.
3.Security testing tools: These identify vulnerabilities in applications and systems. Examples
include Burp Suite, Nessus, Acunetix, etc.
4.API testing tools: These test APIs for functionality, performance, and security. Examples 
include Postman, SoapUI, RestAssured, etc.
5.Mobile testing tools: These test mobile applications on various devices and platforms. 
Examples include Appium, Espresso, XCTest, etc.
