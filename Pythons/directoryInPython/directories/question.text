Another small programming challenge:

1. I would like to search for a few strings inside all files in current directory (and subdirectories as well - the entire tree)

2. I should be easily able to add more strings to my list of strings to be searched without changing the source code

3. I need the output in the following format

-----------------------------------
The following patterns were found:

Pattern 1: search string 1
line number: line
line number: line
line number: line

Pattern 2: search string 2
line number: line
line number: line
line number: line
