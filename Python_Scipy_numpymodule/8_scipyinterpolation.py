# What is interpolation: it is a method for generating points between the given points. and the method of filling the values is called imputation.

# use machine learning, data set pe use.

# now how we can implement it in scipy.? -  via module scipy.interpolate

# 1D interpolation: interp1d()
## here for given xs and ys interpolate values from 2.1, 2.2, 2.3........2.9:
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
import numpy as np
xs = np.arange(10)
ys = 2*xs + 1
interp_func = interp1d(xs, ys)
pb = interp_func(np.arange(2.1, 3, 0.1))
print(pb)

## spline interpolation:
# example: here now we will find the univariate spline interpolation for 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.....2.9 .

from scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSpline
import numpy as np
xs = np.arange(10)
ys = xs**2 + np.sin(xs) + 1

interp_func = UnivariateSpline(xs,ys)
pb = interp_func(np.arange(2.1, 3, 0.1))

print(pb)

## Interpolation with Radial basis Function(RBF):-

from scipy.interpolate import Rbf
import numpy as np
xs = np.arange(10)
ys = xs**2 + np.sin(xs) + 1

interp_func = Rbf(xs,ys)
pb = interp_func(np.arange(2.1, 3, 0.1))

print(pb)
