 Specific Business Process: What is the specific business process you want

 process, its steps, decision points, and involved parties will be crucial 
 for designing an effective schema.

like star schema, snowflake schema, or relational schema might be more 
suitable depending on your needs. I can explain the pros and cons of each

process? Identifying the relevant data elements and their relationships
will form the foundation of the schema.
